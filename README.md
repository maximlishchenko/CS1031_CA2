### Design decisions

I choose the navigation bar to be a bar at the top when the width of the screen is
more than 750px and a burger menu when it is less than or equal to 750px.
That way, it would be convenient for everyone: users on PCs, laptops, and mobile devices.

Next, I've set the content to be centered and it's max-width to be 1200px.
That way, on large screens, the user has the content in the center of the screen, instead
of having to move their head left and right to read something.
On smaller screens, however, the content would fit perfectly into the screen and take up most
of the available space.

For the color choices, I chose the home page to be the most fancy one, as it has to catch the user's eye.
I've decided to put a picture with a panoramic view of the city as a banner/background image and apply
a shadow to it, so that it is not too bright and the text on the banner is clear and readable.
I chose gray to be the color of the navbar, as it suits perfectly for all pages, and isn't too bright and toxic.
On the home page, I've made the navbar a little bit transparent, so that it doesn't cut off the image
and in general I felt that it looks better that way. On the other two pages however, I did not make the
navbar transparent, as there aren't any background images there.
Concerning the other two pages, I decided not to include a background image for those, since they contain
more content and should be more formal and strict, especially the history page.
As for the border colors, I chose them to be solid black on all pages in order to follow the same design.
I felt that making them thin is better than thick since it is just enough to separate the image from the white background.

Also, on the visit.html page, I thought that after a certain width breakpoint (750px), the 7:5 ratio becomes too small to fit
text on the left and especially the image on the right into one row. Because of that, I decided to separate the text and the image
from each other and make them go one after another as 2 rows after the width gets smaller than 750px. However, on larger screens, the
columns behave as normal and take up space according to the 7:5 ratio.

### Challenges I faced

The most difficult part was to start, honestly. When you've got a blank document in front of you and
should design everything from scratch, it takes quite some time to figure out what you should do.
Another challenging thing was to make the burger menu work, but after reading some documentation of
Bootstrap I've managed to make everything work. As for everything else, it was just a matter of trying and testing.
