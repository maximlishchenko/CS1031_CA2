            <p>First mentioned in <b>1154</b> by Arab cartographer Muhammad al-Idrisi, Tallinn takes its roots from centuries ago.
                From the 13th century until the first half of the 20th century Tallinn was known
                in most of the world by variants of its other historical name <b>Reval</b>.</p><br>

            <h2>Ancient and Medieval Tallinn</h2>
                <p>The first traces of hunter-fisherman community migrations in the present day Tallinn's city centre, found by the archeologists are about 5,000 years old.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>As an important port for trade between Russia and Scandinavia, it became a target for the expansion of the Teutonic Knights and the Kingdom of Denmark
                    during the period of Northern Crusades in the beginning of the 13th century when Christianity was forcibly imposed on the local population.
                    Danish rule of Tallinn and Northern Estonia started in <b>1219</b>.</p>
                <p>The king of Denmark sold Reval along with other land possessions in northern Estonia to the Teutonic Knights in <b>1346</b>.
                    Medieval Reval enjoyed a strategic position at the crossroads of trade between Western and Northern Europe and Russia.
                    The city, with a population of about 8,000, was very well fortified with city walls and 66 defence towers.</p><br>

            <h2>Swedish and Russian Tallinn</h2>
                <p>A weather vane, the figure of an old warrior called Old Thomas, was put on top of the spire of the Tallinn Town Hall in <b>1530</b>.
                    Old Thomas has later become a popular symbol of the city.</p>

                <p>Already in the early years of the Protestant Reformation the city converted to Lutheranism. In <b>1561</b>, Reval became a dominion of Sweden.</p>
                <p>During the Great Northern War, plague stricken Tallinn along with Swedish Estonia and Livonia capitulated to Imperial Russia in <b>1710</b>,
                    but the local self-government institutions (Magistracy of Reval and Chivalry of Estonia) retained their cultural and economical autonomy
                    within Imperial Russia as the Governorate of Estonia.</p>
                <p>The Magistracy of Reval was abolished in <b>1889</b>. The 19th century brought industrialisation of the city and the port kept its importance.
                    During the last decades of the century Russification measures became stronger.</p><br><br>

                    and a war of independence with Soviet Russia, after which Tallinn became the capital of independent Estonia.</p>
                <p>During World War II, Estonia was first occupied by the Red Army and annexed into the USSR in <b>1940</b>, then occupied by Nazi Germany from
                    <b>1941</b> to <b>1944</b>. After the German retreat in <b>1944</b>, the city was occupied again by the Soviets. After the annexation of Estonia
                    into the USSR, Tallinn became formally "the capital city" of the Estonian SSR within the Soviet Union.</p><br>
